# Barebones React / Express / Postgres App


## Getting started

Run `script/bootstrap` to prepare the dependencies for the dev environment
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Express is launched as an API backend at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
React is launched at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The app will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Runs any files named `test` or `spec` using Jest.

### `npm run lint`

Runs eslint to check file formatting for all js files.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
